### ⛈️⛈️ there's a storm coming! rest here and read my README while you wait :P

hi stranger :]

I'm Rae/Rachel, an Honors student at Northeastern majoring in Combined CS & Music with a Music Technology concentration, chosen for its intersection of art and technology in gaming. My path here was shaped by realizing CS's creative potential in middle school (making JavaScript games advocating against animal cruelty), growing up immersed in video games (Zelda, Minecraft), and 15 years of piano training that helped me develop absolute pitch. 

Currently, I'm getting some of my first professional game development experience with UPG LLC as an Interactive Game Developer & Designer, developing an educational caverunner game on board with Palura Games (a new startup!), and serving as a Project Lead for Scout Northeastern, working with the band Good Karma. I'm also taking the course Music & Audio for Video Games with acclaimed video game composer Chel Wong! Previously, I interned at Black Soup GmbH in Berlin, leading 4 organic marketing campaigns for titles like Lost Records: Bloom & Rage and Palia, liaising with clients (KRAFTON, Singularity 6), and automating media planning. 

I'm seeking more hands-on video game music composition or sound design experience, in addition to working on audio software like Wwise or FMOD. Let's connect about projects, Zelda lore, or absolute pitch, and see if you can find the hidden treasure on my website!
